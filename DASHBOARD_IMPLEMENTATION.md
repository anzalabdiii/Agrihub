# Complete Dashboard Implementation Guide

Since you want full functionality in all dashboards, I'll provide you with the complete implementation files.

## Step 1: Replace Admin Dashboard

Replace the content of `frontend/src/pages/admin/Dashboard.jsx` with this complete version that includes:
- Real-time stats from backend
- Navigation sidebar
- Quick actions
- Revenue display

The file is ready at the path above. Just reload your browser and you should see:
- Total Farmers counter
- Total Buyers counter
- Pending Products counter
- Pending Orders counter
- Total Revenue
- Quick action buttons

## Step 2: Replace Create Farmer Page

Replace `frontend/src/pages/admin/CreateFarmer.jsx` with the full form that:
- Creates farmer accounts via API
- Validates input
- Shows success/error messages
- Redirects to farmers list after creation

## Next Pages to Implement

I can build out these pages next:

### Admin Pages:
1. ✅ Dashboard (with stats)
2. ✅ Create Farmer (with form)
3. Manage Farmers (table with activate/deactivate)
4. Manage Buyers (table with activate/deactivate)
5. Pending Products (approve/reject products)
6. Pending Orders (approve orders with stock deduction)
7. Manage Categories
8. Activity Logs

### Farmer Pages:
1. Dashboard (analytics)
2. My Products (CRUD)
3. Create Product (form with image upload)
4. Orders (view approved orders)

### Buyer Pages:
1. Dashboard (featured products)
2. Product Listing (browse with filters)
3. Product Detail
4. Cart
5. Orders

Would you like me to continue building out all the pages? I can create them one section at a time (Admin, then Farmer, then Buyer).
